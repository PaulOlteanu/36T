# Shamrok

## Getting the environment ready

1. Clone the repository. `git clone https://github.com/PaulOlteanu/Shamrok.git`

2. Get the virtualenv set up. This avoids having to install the libraries globally. This command will also install the required dependencies `make venv`

3. Test it. These should all pass. `make test`

4. Create the database. This should be a postgresql database, with no password with the name of "Shamrok". After installing postgres: `createdb Shamrok`

5. Apply the schema to the database. `./manage.py db upgrade`

## Running the server

1. Run the server. `./manage.py runserver`
